	abstract = {We develop estimation for potentially high-dimensional additive structural equation models. A key component of our approach is to decouple order search among the variables from feature or edge selection in a directed acyclic graph encoding the causal structure. We show that the former can be done with nonregularized (restricted) maximum likelihood estimation while the latter can be efficiently addressed using sparse regression techniques. Thus, we substantially simplify the problem of structure search and estimation for an important class of causal models. We establish consistency of the (restricted) maximum likelihood estimator for low- and high-dimensional scenarios, and we also allow for misspecification of the error distribution. Furthermore, we develop an efficient computational algorithm which can deal with many variables, and the new method's accuracy and performance is illustrated on simulated and real data.},

	abstract = {How should one quantify the strength of association between two random variables without bias for relationships of a specific form? Despite its conceptual simplicity, this notion of statistical “equitability” has yet to receive a definitive mathematical formalization. Here we argue that equitability is properly formalized by a self-consistency condition closely related to Data Processing Inequality. Mutual information, a fundamental quantity in information theory, is shown to satisfy this equitability criterion. These findings are at odds with the recent work of Reshef et al. [Reshef {DN}, et al. (2011) Science 334(6062):1518–1524], which proposed an alternative definition of equitability and introduced a new statistic, the “maximal information coefficient” ({MIC}), said to satisfy equitability in contradistinction to mutual information. These conclusions, however, were supported only with limited simulation evidence, not with mathematical arguments. Upon revisiting these claims, we prove that the mathematical definition of equitability proposed by Reshef et al. cannot be satisfied by any (nontrivial) dependence measure. We also identify artifacts in the reported simulation evidence. When these artifacts are removed, estimates of mutual information are found to be more equitable than estimates of {MIC}. Mutual information is also observed to have consistently higher statistical power than {MIC}. We conclude that estimating mutual information provides a natural (and often practical) way to equitably quantify statistical associations in large datasets.},

	title = {Estimating Mutual Information for Discrete-Continuous Mixtures},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06212},
	abstract = {Estimating mutual information from observed samples is a basic primitive, useful in several machine learning tasks including correlation mining, information bottleneck clustering, learning a Chow-Liu tree, and conditional independence testing in (causal) graphical models. While mutual information is a well-defined quantity in general probability spaces, existing estimators can only handle two special cases of purely discrete or purely continuous pairs of random variables. The main challenge is that these methods first estimate the (differential) entropies of X, Y and the pair (X;Y) and add them up with appropriate signs to get an estimate of the mutual information. These 3H-estimators cannot be applied in general mixture spaces, where entropy is not well-defined. In this paper, we design a novel estimator for mutual information of discrete-continuous mixtures. We prove that the proposed estimator is consistent. We provide numerical experiments suggesting superiority of the proposed estimator compared to other heuristics of adding small continuous noise to all the samples and applying standard estimators tailored for purely continuous variables, and quantizing the samples and applying standard estimators tailored for purely discrete variables. This significantly widens the applicability of mutual information estimation in real-world applications, where some variables are discrete, some continuous, and others are a mixture between continuous and discrete components.},

We present an accurate, non-binning {MI} estimator for the case of one discrete data set and one continuous data set. This case applies when measuring, for example, the relationship between base sequence and gene expression level, or the effect of a cancer drug on patient survival time. We also show how our method can be adapted to calculate the Jensen–Shannon divergence of two or more data sets.},
